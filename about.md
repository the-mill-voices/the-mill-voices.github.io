Between February and June 2016, I worked as a Research Associate for Goldsmiths University of London, based at The Mill. The placement was possible by the AHRC Cultural Engagement Fund. Over this period I looked into the emergence of The Mill and the impact it has on the community in terms of reception and production of arts and culture in the borough. My research also analyses the connection of The Mill’s history with the recent history of austerity politics and the arts in the UK. To help bring a fuller picture to the history of The Mill I’ve interviewed St James Street Library Campaigners; The Mill initiators, trustees, volunteers, and staff; programme and activity leaders; and users.

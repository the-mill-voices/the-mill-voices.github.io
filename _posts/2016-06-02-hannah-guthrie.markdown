I move to Walthamstow nearly five years ago. We must have come to The Mill when there was the launch party, there was lots of food, music and people, and it seemed very exciting and vibrant. I was working full-time, but I came in to meet Neil who was in charge of the comms, so I made the Facebook for the Mill. In 2014, I approached the board of trustees to see if there were any vacancies and I joined the board and became treasurer. April this year, I became the Chair of the trustees, and took the strategic comms trustee, so thatâ€™s what I am doing now.

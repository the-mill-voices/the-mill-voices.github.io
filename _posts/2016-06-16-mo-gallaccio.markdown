We used to open up on Saturday for people to come in, have a look, and to engage volunteers in the refurbishment of the building and the running of the project. People with several skills came in, and The Mill emerged as a holding company for the building, nurturing local peopleâ€™s talents. The gradual transformation was amazing - a welcoming community space, made by the community for the community.

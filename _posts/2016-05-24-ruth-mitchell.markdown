I think for a lot of people it fills up their day, gives it structure, it gives them something to do and a place to belong. 'specially for retired people, if you used to have loads of responsibility, a work life and then you know, your life, your world becomes quite small, volunteering keeps your world quite round, and big. It’s a great way of meeting people, if you think you don’t have loads of contacts in the area, it’s a great place to come on a Wednesday afternoon during knitting, just come and have a little knit-natter, I think that’s really nice for people.

When they shut the Library down I was outside picketing. I don't know since when, but I've been coming to the Knitting Group. It's just so friendly. I knit a lot, this blanket I'm doing I've knitted over 700 of them, but I will only do it if people ask. It's a lot of work, I just do it as a hobby really.

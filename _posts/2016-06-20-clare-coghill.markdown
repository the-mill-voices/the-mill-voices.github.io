I tried to be a facilitator in terms of the interaction with the local authority. To get the St James Street Campaigners, many of whom became Mill activists, into meetings in the Town Hall to have those conversations about switching it from a campaign, that necessarily have been very negative, to something that was about, how do we take that forward to create a space that will still be open for whole of the community. There was a genuinely desire to work as a team from the start, and I think that really continued. The best thing about The Mill is the people, because thatâ€™s who made it.

The Mill is really welcoming to everyone. If you look back at the Postcards exhibition we did in 2015, I think represented that perfectly. We had school children from a special needs school, local artists, Turner Prize winners, all in the same frames, it’s almost like a snapshot of The Mill. It’s really a great affection for the building.

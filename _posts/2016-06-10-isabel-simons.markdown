I don’t know who coined the phrase (Honesty Library), but I think I have expanded that idea, because other people thought that it would be one book out and one book in, but, specially now, we have books flooding in and we don’t need to be possessive. I think of it as being like on of the free libraries but on a bigger scale. That is a movement that started in America where people juts sort of erected small collections of books outside their houses. That’s how it begun, and people just help themselves and people will put books back.

Because we knew we were going to be volunteering focused we needed somebody to really reach out into the community, and bringing really lots of different types of people to reflect the diversity of the area. We really wanted the Mill to make a splash in that way, so local residents could feel that they were empowered to take charge of the Mill and it was their space to use.

Because we knew we were going to be volunteer-focussed, and reliant on volunteers, we needed a Community Organiser to reach out into the community and bring lots of different types of people into The Mill to reflect the diversity of the area. We really wanted The Mill to make a splash, so that local residents could feel that they were empowered to take charge of The Mill and that it was their space to use.

When The Mill opened I immediately offered my help because I have done community art projects and I believe in community things, so we made a cardboard Rhino for the children and they’ve painted it, and it became part of the children’s room. It was so popular that then I made another animal a year or two later, and then another animal, which is the elephant. The children decorate it, so it can be something which they’ve done, which is in the playroom, and also it makes the playroom a bit more jolly.

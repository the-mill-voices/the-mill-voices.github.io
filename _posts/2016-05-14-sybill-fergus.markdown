I used to bring my children here when it was a library. I have been bringing my grandchildren Mia and Kya for nearly 2 years for Kids Art. We come along and they have a lot to do, and I think it really stretch them, because Mia is now a very good artist, she draws what she sees with such interest, and she was very shy at first, she has blossomed. Kya was quite young, but Mo let her mess about, now she can actually do things which are interesting. Everything that sheâ€™s done goes to my fridge at home. It is here where they first learn to actually make shapes, it is very good.

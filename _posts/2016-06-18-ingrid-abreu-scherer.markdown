The building was in a variable state. Some rooms were just about OK, some were very bad and some were completely uninhabitable. We had to think about how do we turn the building into something usable, and how do we do it for free, or for cheap. One of the things we did was to work with a local architect, Joe Swift. He put an advert in various trade’s newspapers online asking for designers, and we got about five designers. They came from Italy, Russia, Ireland, and the UK, we housed them upstairs and they they enjoyed it. They were able to make a lot of decisions that they wouldn’t be able to make in a more controlled design job.

A week before Easter (2007) there was the usual sign on the window about the opening hours and closure for the holidays. After that, the doors remained shut. Books were piling up behind the doors and there was no news about the closure. Many of us thought that it was waiting for renovation work as Central Library was being renovated at that time. I felt that an injustice was being done to the community. I started “Save St James Street Library Campaign” because I wanted to save a beloved 30-year-old library.

You can have a cup of coffee and tea on donation, you meet people, and you can read some books while your child can play. She can find new friends and I can find new friends as well. What I like the most is to be able to come at anytime, and there are friendly people around. I borrow books, I bring some of my books. We like the art club and I am going to start the Spanish classes here this month.

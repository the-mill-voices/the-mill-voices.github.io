I got involved with the Gardening Group pretty much from the time the Mill opened. NÃºria from Blackhorse Action Group run the Gardening Group and I took over the leadership when she stepped down. I did that for a couple of years, and then I handed it to Monica, who is doing it now. Things like the Knitting Group or the Gardening Group are things that I enjoy, that allow me to give something to the community, but also just have that kind of social engagement, wanting to meet people who live locally.

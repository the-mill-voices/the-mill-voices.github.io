I always say admin is like the engine room. The captain decided where the ship's going, the navigator steers it, but you need someone in the engine room to make sure you've got power to get where you-re going. For the future, I would love some way of opening up the garden more. I would like to see a wider range of people coming in and out. I would like to see more room hire, and more use of the living room by people as a meeting up space.

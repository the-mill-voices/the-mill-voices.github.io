I always though admin is like the engine room, and then you’ve got other people that steer the ship, or have the vision of where the ship’s going. But you need someone in the engine room. For the future, I would love some way of opening up the garden more. I would like to see a wider range of people coming in and out. I would like to see more room hire, and more use of the living room by people as a meeting up space.

Right from the beginning of The Mill we started the Knitting Group and people are brilliant, we all support each other. We are a self/help group, between us all we normally manage to sort problems out, there is no right or wrong way of knitting. If you get a nice garment out of it, it doesn't really matter how you've done it. I enjoy the company, do the knitting, it gets sold and the money goes to The Mill.

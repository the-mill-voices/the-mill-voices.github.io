I've been hiring the Garden room and teaching Yoga here for the last 3 years. I was looking for a place located at the heart of the community that people from all walks of life could use. I am very much about teaching people who wouldn't access a mainstream Yoga studio, community groups, marginalised people. The Mill is lovely, it has a real mixture of usages, from my Yoga to Spanish classes, meditation, knitting and art, anyone can hire the rooms and have a home for their group to meet in.

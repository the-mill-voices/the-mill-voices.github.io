I was born in Walthamstow, I went away to study when I came back in 2012 and The Mill had appeared. I got involved, Iâ€™ve been exhibiting here, reading poems, and then I started volunteering here. When I spend time at The Mill I get into a mind set of positive energy and wonder. The Mill feels like the only space in the world where a Van Gogh can exhibit next to my cousin in primary school and its fine. That level of consideration is full and flourish.

I think the biggest thing I would love to see happen is to be able to get the money to properly repurpose the building and utilise all the space. Get a community kitchen put in, expand these rooms, and create a toilet upstairs for the tenants. I think that would mean we could fully utilise the building, and the Mill could be at its full potential. Having a community kitchen would be absolutely brilliant.

We had the open air library once a month and different people would get involved, like the folk club came and they would do some music, lots of people would come and perform, and we did different things outside just to keep the focus on the building. So that was the campaign to reopen the library and I do think we lost. The importance thing then was to save the building, because once the building went it was gone as a public resource.

For more than 15 years I'm working with the community. Many people come to my group every week, they come to build their confidence and we have the support of The Mill. We are doing socialization, English classes, health advise, and small courses so people can build their skills and run their own business> sewing and knitting, soap making. I am encouraging people to grow their own plants, we do cancer awareness sessions and we provide training for volunteers. I've changed many people's lives, thus i love my work. 100% volunteer.

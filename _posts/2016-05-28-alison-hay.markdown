The Mill is a complex organisation. Because we have to raise our own funding, and weâ€™re all volunteers - except for our amazing little staff team - we've got to work in a very professional and people focused way. We talk about things a lot in order to find imaginative solutions to running a place full of activity, dreams and ambitions.

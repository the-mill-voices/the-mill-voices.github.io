The Mill is a complex organization, because we have to raise our own funding, weâ€™ve got to work in a very professional way, a very people focused way, and we are doing that almost entirely with volunteers, except for our amazing little staff team, its mostly volunteer led. We take it really seriously, we make sure we do it as well as we possibly can, we talk about things a lot, and find imaginative solutions to run a place, which is full of activity, full of dreams and full of ambitions.

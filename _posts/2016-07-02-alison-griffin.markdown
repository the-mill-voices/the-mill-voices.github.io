By the end of 2010, Haroon Khan, who works in Brussels but had been on our email list, said we should be applying to the NESTA neighbourhood challenge to do something ambitious with the building. NESTA was doing a shortlist for about three days before the deadline to give the building to auctioneers for sale. I said, I can fill in forms, so I did that. I thought, if I can get us on that shortlist, then we can buy time, which is exactly what happened. We’d bought time; the building is still in public hands, and that’s good.

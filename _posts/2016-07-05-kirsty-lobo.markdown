I was using the Library twice a week with the children. It was a nice space, quiet, close, warm and I met people I knew there; it was perfect. I met Phaik in a playgroup, we started a petition and from there we met all these people who knew about procedures. We went to the council and appealed, they said no. I felt defeated; I'm very glad there were people very concerned about the public asset that have put so much energy in. I'm pleased they've managed to do what they've done with it.

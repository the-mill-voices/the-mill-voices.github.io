Blackhorse Action Group's role as a residency association was to work with whichever groups were going and to support them by making videos, helping with the campaign, featuring them in the website and Twitter. The NESTA funding was done through BAG because we were constituted. It's great that BAG has served it's purpose. It saved the building if not the Library. The first time we had an open day it was an amazing atmosphere, it was tatty inside but opening those doors, people coming in, it was amazing.

The Mill radio has been going on for a year. We record a little podcast; David puts it on to the web. I do a Mill what’s on slot so I can tell people what we’re up to, and we talk with people, find out about them. Plus people get in touch with us, saying I’ve done this, or I’ve got a project. I love to meet people, that’s what I enjoy about The Mill, it’s all these different cultures coming together and I think that’s great.

I think the role of the reception is so important, to have a welcoming smile and greeting; first impressions can be hugely important. If I have a volunteer shadowing me I would say the most important thing to learn and to practice is this warm welcome smile and warm greeting, if you forget anything else it doesnâ€™t matter, because people will probably come back.
